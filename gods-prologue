God loves simple things. So he made men.
But then, men fell in love, and lost all their simplicity.

So he made engineers.
But like those men of less vigor who fell in love
so have engineers fallen in love with 'complexity'.
And complexity is a divine woman.
Men who love her, often boast how they could reduce
the complex design of such a woman, and understand her
(understanding a woman is an impossible task).
These diseased false engineers can be identified
when they talk about 'abstractions'.

The prophecy of God is the most divine.
Nature is much more simple than we imagine.
So are people.
Elegance is emergent through simplicity
Love is simple. Godsend is simple.
